An immediate, realistic and sustainable plan for the resettlement and humanitarian rehabilitation of the entire Arab population in the Gaza Strip is required which aligns well with the economic and geopolitical interests of Israel, Egypt, the USA and Saudi Arabia.\n• In 2017, it was reported that there are about 10 million vacant housing units in Egypt, of which about half are built and half are under construction. For example, in the two largest satellite cities of Cairo, \"The 6th of October\" and \"The 10th of Ramadan\", there is a huge amount of built and empty apartments owned by the government and privately and construction areas sufficient to house about 6 million residents.\n• The average cost of a 3-room apartment with an area of 95 square meters for an average Gazan family consisting of 5.14 people in one of the two cities indicated above is about $19,000. Taking into account the currently known size of the entire population living in the Gaza Strip, which ranges from about 1.4 For approximately 2.2 million people, it can be estimated that the total amount that will be required to be transferred to Egypt to finance the project will be on the order of 5 to 8 billion dollars.\n• Throwing an immediate stimulus at such a height to the Egyptian economy will provide a tremendous and immediate benefit to al-Sisi's regime. These sums of money, in relation to the Israeli economy, are minimal. Investing a few billion dollars (even if it is 20 or 30 billion dollars) to solve this difficult issue is an innovative, cheap and sustainable solution.\n• There is no doubt that in order for this plan to come to fruition, many conditions must exist at the same time.

And if under such action innocent blood will be spilled, the guilt will be solely on the heads of the cruel [Hamas] murderers and their supporters”.   ","notes":"About 50 Jewish rabbis wrote in a letter to Netanyahu that there is no religious or moral objection to bombing Al-Shifa Hospital and its occupants if “enemies” are hiding inside”, Israeli right-wing journalist Amit Segal shared a letter from 45 influential Israeli rabbis (initial list), addressed to “Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu May His Light Shine, the heads of state and security apparatus,” explicitly affirming the right of the state to bomb the Al-Shifa’ hospital in Gaza – the main hospital in the strip. There are several notable rabbis among the list of signatories who have advocated for the killing of “enemy babies” in the past. Rabbis Yitzhak Shapira and Yosef Elitzur explicitly wrote this in their 2009 book Torat Hamelech (King’s Torah), claiming that such babies can often be in the way of killing the enemy and that their killing is therefore permitted. In addition, they wrote their murder is permitted under the justification that these babies “will grow to harm us.”        One of the authors of Torat Hamelech, Yitzhak Shapira, rabbi of the Od Yosef Hai yeshiva in Yitzhar, is a signatory to yesterday’s letter (the yeshiva was notably recipient of Kushner family fund grants until 2011). Two other rabbis on the list of signatories, Dov Lior (first signatory, former rabbi of Kiryat Arba and spiritual mentor of Itamar Ben-Gvir (https://mondoweiss.net/2023/01/itamar-ben-gvir-is-trying-to-make-the-aqsa-compound-a-shared-site/) and Yitzchak Ginzburg (third signatory, affiliated with Chabad movement) have endorsed the King’s Torah book. ·","themes":["civilian-harm","genocidal-intent","forced-displacement"],"permalink":"https://perma.cc/4EJR-2LBQ","sources":[{"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CzCP0UXLMYx/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D","domain":"instagram.com"},{"url":"https://mondoweiss.net/2023/10/israeli-rabbis-tell-netanyahu-that-israel-has-a-right-to-bomb-al-shifa-hospital-in-gaza/?utm_content=bufferfcc79&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=buffer","domain":"mondoweiss.net"}]},{"id":160,"date":"30/10/2023","person":"Israeli Army","position":"Army","sector":"armed-forces","details":"“In case you don’t surrender your weapons and stop the fire, hell’s gates will open upon you as it did in Gaza.”","notes":"IDF distributes military notes in AlKhalil (Hebron)","themes":["civilian-harm","collective-punishment"],"permalink":"","sources":[{"url":"GYkq59YWAAAUrU_ (253×450) (twimg.com)","domain":"GYkq59YWAAAUrU_ (253×450) (twimg.com)"}]},{"id":161,"date":"31/10/2023","person":"Richard Hecht","position":"International IDF spokesperson / Lieutenant colonel","sector":"armed-forces","details":"\"There could be tunnels there, this is the tragedy of war, we've been saying for days for civillians who are not involved with Hamas to move South.
