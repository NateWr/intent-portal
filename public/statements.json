    "details": "Position paper: A plan for resettlement and final rehabilitation in Egypt of the entire population of Gaza: economic aspects: Main points:\n• There is currently a unique and rare opportunity to evacuate the entire Gaza Strip in coordination with the Egyptian government. An immediate, realistic and sustainable plan for the resettlement and humanitarian rehabilitation of the entire Arab population in the Gaza Strip is required which aligns well with the economic and geopolitical interests of Israel, Egypt, the USA and Saudi Arabia.\n• In 2017, it was reported that there are about 10 million vacant housing units in Egypt, of which about half are built and half are under construction. For example, in the two largest satellite cities of Cairo, \"The 6th of October\" and \"The 10th of Ramadan\", there is a huge amount of built and empty apartments owned by the government and privately and construction areas sufficient to house about 6 million residents.\n• The average cost of a 3-room apartment with an area of 95 square meters for an average Gazan family consisting of 5.14 people in one of the two cities indicated above is about $19,000. Taking into account the currently known size of the entire population living in the Gaza Strip, which ranges from about 1.4 For approximately 2.2 million people, it can be estimated that the total amount that will be required to be transferred to Egypt to finance the project will be on the order of 5 to 8 billion dollars.\n• Throwing an immediate stimulus at such a height to the Egyptian economy will provide a tremendous and immediate benefit to al-Sisi's regime. These sums of money, in relation to the Israeli economy, are minimal. Investing a few billion dollars (even if it is 20 or 30 billion dollars) to solve this difficult issue is an innovative, cheap and sustainable solution.\n• There is no doubt that in order for this plan to come to fruition, many conditions must exist at the same time. Currently, these conditions are met and it is unclear when such an opportunity will arise again, if ever.",

And if under such action innocent blood will be spilled, the guilt will be solely on the heads of the cruel [Hamas] murderers and their supporters”.   There are several notable rabbis among the list of signatories who have advocated for the killing of “enemy babies” in the past. Rabbis Yitzhak Shapira and Yosef Elitzur explicitly wrote this in their 2009 book Torat Hamelech (King’s Torah), claiming that such babies can often be in the way of killing the enemy and that their killing is therefore permitted. In addition, they wrote their murder is permitted under the justification that these babies “will grow to harm us.”        One of the authors of Torat Hamelech, Yitzhak Shapira, rabbi of the Od Yosef Hai yeshiva in Yitzhar, is a signatory to yesterday’s letter (the yeshiva was notably recipient of Kushner family fund grants until 2011). Two other rabbis on the list of signatories, Dov Lior (first signatory, former rabbi of Kiryat Arba and spiritual mentor of Itamar Ben-Gvir (https://mondoweiss.net/2023/01/itamar-ben-gvir-is-trying-to-make-the-aqsa-compound-a-shared-site/) and Yitzchak Ginzburg (third signatory, affiliated with Chabad movement) have endorsed the King’s Torah book. ·",

When there is absolute evil, one must not look back, one must not express empathy. The actions of the oppressors on Black Sabbath [meaning october 7th] are tens of times worse than the actions of Sodom and Gomorrah.

There are more trucks along the border 132 trucks have been stopped and Hamas is going to bed hungry today, but we are going to continue to do these actions to ensure that this thing is stopped for good. We think that these actions will reach the top and make the long-awaited change.

First of all, we need to win this war in Gaza and see it through to the end. In Gaza, I also want to encourage voluntary immigration, of course, I think it's a humanitarian solution in the end. [Interviewer]: In the end, you'll end up with many Gazans who will not emigrate voluntarily, what will you do with them? [Ben-Gvir]: I think that if we decide, a large part of them will want to emigrate voluntarily. [Interviewer]: And if not? [Ben-Gvir]: I am sure that if we subdue [Hamas], If we win, but a real victory and not be neither here nor there, but go with this victory till the end, a large part of them will want to emigrate […] [interviewer]: You are actually forcing them, you should say, you package it in some nice wording of \"voluntary immigration\" but in the end you're expelling them if you're doing so by applying pressure. [Ben-Gvir]: You don't know how many Gazans there are today who say, we want to get out of here, there are some there who are willing to sell a kidney just to get out of there. [Interviewer]: What do you do with those who stay? [Ben-Gvir]: I assume that if we win, most of them will agree to emigrate voluntarily. Now in Judea and Samaria, I'll say it in the simplest way: No more relying rely on the PA, the same PA of terrorists, haven't we seen what's happening? Didn't we see where this has led us? It's the same old concept, after all 82% of them support the massacre, after all the Authority itself distributes money to those who murdered, there is no such thing, someone who murders a Jew receives money from the Authority, their education system broadcasts murder and massacre, so what? There is no more PA, cancel the PA, no to supporting them, no to strengthening them, they will fall, and we should be the owners of the house in Judea and Samaria.\"",

Gaza is among the smallest and most densely populated cities in the world.\n\nThere has been little space, or time, for families to have funerals - or even grieve - during Israel’s bombardment. Some\nhospitals have been forced to bury people before their relatives could identify them because there’s not enough space in the morgues to keep them.\n\nScared parents scrawl children’s names on their arms and legs in the hopes they will at least be identified after they die.\n\nIn addition to relentless bombing, Israel has blocked food, water, fuel and electricity in the Gaza Strip. As of publishing, over 20,000 people have been killed. 70% of them are women and children.",

Terrorists hiding inside a school were eliminated at night with precision munitions. The IDF leadership continues to forget the language of the enemy! \nA school where murderous terrorists who run a command post are hiding - we are obligated to be  and flatten the entire school with inaccurate munitions. That's the only way to win! Why would Hamas agree to a deal to release hostages when the IDF leadership is busy taking the enemy into consideration all the time?\"",

For years, the left in the State of Israel has brainwashed some of us with the message that the mother of a heroic IDF soldier and the mother of a damned \"martyr\" are experiencing the same pain. [...] in the language of the \"non-involved\" terrorists, I say: \"Alf Um Mukharribin tibki, wala Umm Israelia tebki - May a thousand mothers of terrorists cry, so that one Israeli mother will not cry! We will continue to back our heroic fighters, emissaries of God in IDF uniforms - until the complete victory over absolute evil, God willing.\" (writer note: by saying in the language of terrorrists - she meant Arabic.)",
